# function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.
